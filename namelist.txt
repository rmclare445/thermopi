#-Variables------------------------------------------------------
#
# n_phase   = number of phases (must = # elements in phase lists)
# phase_hr  = beginning hour(s) of respective phase(s)
# phase_min = beginning minute(s) of respective phase(s)
# phase_T   = temperature(s) of respective phase(s)
# up_tol    = tolerance above target to trigger shutoff
# dn_tol    = tolerance below target to trigger relay
# freq      = frequency in Hz of temperature check/log
#

# Phase configuration ( n_phase = len(phase_*) )

# Data frequency (in units of per second)
